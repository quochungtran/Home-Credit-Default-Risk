# Home Credit Default Risk 


Link dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data 

## Description 

Many credit-worthy people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

Home Credit strives to enable lending to unbanked customers by using a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

In this project, we will apply statistical and machine learning methods to unlock the full potential of alternative data. Therefore, we will be able to evaluate borrowerâ€™s creditworthiness to minimize credit risk and to maximize the profitability.
